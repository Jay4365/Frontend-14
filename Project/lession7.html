      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <hr />
      <h1><b>Personally Identifiable Information that You Provide to Us</b></h1>
      <p>
        We do not collect personally identifiable information e.g., name, e-mail
        address, contact or similar information unless you choose to provide it
        to us. If you voluntarily provide us with personal information, for
        example by sending an e-mail or by filling out a form and submitting it
        through our Website, we may use that information only to respond to your
        message and to help us provide you with the information or services that
        you request. To the extent that we process your personal information
        based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time as
        stated below.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h1>Account Registration Information</h1>
      <p>
        In some instances, use of the Clients on Demand Website and Services may
        require that you disclose certain personal information for
        identification, including a unique email address and demographic
        information (including, for example, ZIP code, age, sex, job industry,
        job title, and income) to register.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h1>Billing and Credit Card Information</h1>
      <p>
        Our Services comprise, generally business coaching Webinars, Seminars
        and materials distributed on a subscription basis. To enable payment, we
        collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit
        card information, and other billing information. This information will
        only be shared with third parties who facilitate completion of the
        purchase transaction, such as by fulfilling orders and processing credit
        card payments.<br />

        We will not disclose your billing and/or credit card information unless
        required by law or a court order, or unless disclosure is required to
        address an issue implicated by the financial transaction. For instance,
        if you claim that your billing and/or credit card information was used
        to make a purchase you did not authorize, details about the transaction
        may be disclosed to law enforcement and any party we deem necessary to
        address the matter.

        How to access, correct, delete or exercise other rights regarding your
        Personal Information
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you would like to request to access, correct, object to the use,
        restrict or delete personal information that you have previously
        provided to us, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic
        copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to
        another company, you may contact us at support@russruffino.com with the
        subject line “Data Subject Request.” We will attempt to comply with your
        request. However, the nature of our business, along with the applicable
        law governing our business, requires us to retain your information for
        several years. Please also note that we may need to retain certain
        information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any
        transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion
        (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be
        able to change or delete the personal information provided until after
        the completion of such purchase or promotion). There may also be
        residual information that will remain within our databases and other
        records, which will not be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, we cannot guarantee the deletion of all your information.
        But, when we receive a deletion request, we will remove your applicable
        information from our marketing and billing systems accordingly. This
        will ensure that there are no further mailings or billings directed
        towards you.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we continue to refine our systems, we will establish a method for the
        complete removal of all user information from the system without
        compromising our legal and ethical duties. This document will evolve as
        these new methods are defined and tested for permanent account deletion.
      </p>
      <p>
        For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the
        personal information associated with the particular email address that
        you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity
        before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your
        request as soon as reasonably practicable.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h1>Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of information</h1>
      <p>
        We may use the information you provide for marketing purposes such as

        choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information
        for marketing purposes. You may opt-out from receiving electronic
        communications from us if you are a user of products or services and no
        longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a
        going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these
        marketing-related emails by sending a request for list removal to
        <a href="file:///C:/HTML/Frontend/CSS/lession6.html#">GJAS</a> If you
        have provided your information to us, and opt-out, we will put in place
        processes to honor your request. This may entail keeping some
        information for the purpose of remembering that you have opted-out.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably
        practicable. Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving
        marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you messages for
        administrative or other purposes directly relating to your use of the
        products or services, and you cannot opt-out from receiving those
        messages.

      <h1>Data Retention</h1>
      <p>

          for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as
          in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or
          regulatory investigations).
